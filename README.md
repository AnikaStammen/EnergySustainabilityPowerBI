# Energy and Sustainability Report for the G20 countries in PowerBI

The "G20 Energy and Sustainability Analysis" project utilized Power BI to develop an interactive report on environmental data from the G20 countries. This initiative aimed to provide insights into energy use, pollution levels, renewable energy adoption, and overall sustainability practices across these nations, facilitating better policy decisions and awareness regarding global environmental impacts. The PowerPoint presented in class as well as the pdf of the PowerBI file are in this repository.

**Data Description**

The raw data, sourced from the World Bank , consisted of numerous environmental metrics such as CO2 emissions, methane emissions, renewable energy consumption, and pollution levels from the G20 countries covering the period from 1990 to 2022. This dataset underwent extensive cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure accurate and insightful visualizations both in Python and with DAX code in PowerBI.

**Analysis and Insights**

The analysis highlighted significant findings including stagnant per capita CO2 emissions among G20 countries since 1990, a slight rise in overall energy consumption, and varying renewable energy adoption rates. Developed countries showed higher per capita emissions while emerging nations had higher total emissions, indicating differing environmental impacts and sustainability challenges.

**Visualizations**

The Power BI report featured dynamic visualizations that allowed users to explore data across multiple dimensions, including time series analysis of emissions, comparative renewable energy usage, and pollution metrics across different countries. Interactive elements in the report enabled stakeholders to drill down into specific data points for more detailed insights.

**Results**
The visualizations revealed a complex picture of environmental efforts and challenges within the G20. While some countries made significant strides in reducing pollution and increasing renewable energy use, others lagged, reflecting the diverse economic and policy landscapes across these nations.
